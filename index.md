# Introduction

The *org.clapper.classutil* (ClassUtil) library is a Scala package that
provides various class location and class generation capabilities, including:

* Methods to locate and filter classes quickly, at runtime--more quickly, in
  fact, than can be done with the JVM's runtime reflection capabilities.
* Methods for converting Scala maps into Java Beans, on the fly--which can be
  useful when generating data for use with APIs (e.g., template APIs) that
  accept Java Beans, but not maps.
* Methods that convert Scala objects into Java beans, without requiring
  the use of the `@BeanProperty` annotation--especially useful when passing
  `case class` objects into Java Bean-aware APIs.

Under the covers, ClassUtil uses the [ASM][] bytecode library, though it
can easily be extended to use a different byte code library.

ClassUtil is fast for several reasons:

* A bytecode library, like [ASM][], loads compiled bytecode without using
  a JVM class loader. So, it avoids all the class loader's overhead.
* ClassUtil's class-finder methods load and return information about
  classes using an efficient lazy iterator, which offers minimal startup
  penalty and the ability to terminate the traversal before reading
  and loading all the elements.

## Runtime requirements

ClassUtil uses the following libraries, which must be present in the
classpath at runtime:

* The main [ASM][] library (version 4 or better)
* The [ASM][] commons library (version 4 or better)
* The [Grizzled Scala][] library
* The [Grizzled SLF4J][] library, for logging
* The [SLF4J][] API library, for logging (e.g., `slf4j-api-1.6.4.jar`)
* An SLF4J implementation, such as [Logback][] or [AVSL][], if you want
  logging.

# Installation

ClassUtil is published to my [Bintray Maven repository][], which is
automatically linked to Bintray's [JCenter][] repository. It's also sync'd
to Maven Central.

* Version 1.5.0 and newer support Scala 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. (Support
  for 2.10 has been dropped.)
* Versions 1.0.13 through 1.4.x support Scala 2.10, 2.11, and 2.12.
* Versions 1.0.7 through 1.0.12 support Scala 2.10, 2.11, and 2.12-Mx.
* Version 1.0.5 supports Scala 2.10 and 2.11.
* Versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.4 support Scala 2.10.
* Version 1.0.0 supports Scala 2.10.0-M7
* Version 0.4.6 supports Scala 2.9.2, 2.9.1-1, 2.9.1, 2.9.0-1, 2.9.0, 2.8.2,
  2.8.1 and 2.8.0.

## Installing with Maven

Specify the `classutil` artifact:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.clapper</groupId>
      <artifactId>classutil_2.11</artifactId>
      <version>1.5.0</version>
    </dependency>

For more information on using Maven and Scala, see Josh Suereth's
[Scala Maven Guide][].

## Using with SBT

With SBT 0.13.x or 1.x, use:

    libraryDependencies += "org.clapper" %% "classutil" % "1.5.0"

to get the latest version of ClassUtil.

# Building from Source

You can also build ClassUtil from source. There are two ways to get the
source:

## Downloading a snapshot of the source

You can download a tarball or zip file of the source from the
[downloads page][].

## Source Code Repository

The source code for ClassUtil is maintained on [GitHub][]. To clone
the repository, run this command:

    git clone git://github.com/bmc/classutil.git

## Building

Building the library requires [SBT][] 1.x and a 1.8 Java JDK.

You can build with this one simple command:

    sbt +compile +package

The resulting jar files will be under the top-level `target` directory, in
subdirectories specific to each Scala version.

# Using ClassUtil

## Finding classes at runtime

ClassUtil is simple to use. The primary class in the library is the
`ClassFinder` class, which has a corresponding companion object that
contains utility methods. The following examples illustrate use of the
library.

### Getting information on all classes in the current class path

{% highlight scala %}
import org.clapper.classutil.ClassFinder

val finder = ClassFinder()
val classes = finder.getClasses // classes is an Iterator[ClassInfo]
classes.foreach(println)
{% endhighlight %}

### Getting all concrete classes in a custom class path

{% highlight scala %}
import org.clapper.classutil.ClassFinder
import java.io.File

val classpath = List("foo.jar", "bar.jar", "baz.zip").map(new File(_))
val finder = ClassFinder(classpath)
val classes = finder.getClasses.filter(_.isConcrete)
classes.foreach(println)
{% endhighlight %}

### Getting all interfaces in a custom class path

{% highlight scala %}
import org.clapper.classutil.ClassFinder
import java.io.File

val classpath = List("foo.jar", "bar.jar", "baz.zip").map(new File(_))
val finder = ClassFinder(classpath)
val classes = finder.getClasses.filter(_.isInterface)
classes.foreach(println)
{% endhighlight %}

### Finding all classes that implement an interface, directly or indirectly

Being able to locate all classes that implement an interface or extend an
abstract class is sometimes useful. For example, if you're implementing a
plugin capability, you may need to discover all concrete classes that
implement your plugin interface. The `ClassFinder` companion object
provides a special utility function for that:

{% highlight scala %}
import org.clapper.classutil.ClassFinder
import java.io.File

val classpath = List("foo.jar", "bar.jar", "baz.zip").map(new File(_))
val finder = ClassFinder(classpath)
val classes = finder.getClasses
val plugins = ClassFinder.concreteSubclasses("org.example.plugin", classes)
plugins.foreach(println)
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the `concreteSubclasses()` method called above takes the iterator
of `ClassInfo` objects returned by `ClassFinder.getClasses`. This
`concreteSubclasses` method converts the iterator to a map of classes, for
easier lookup. Thus, upon its return, the iterator will be empty. You can
certainly recreate the iterator, but at a cost. If you need to make
multiple calls to `concreteSubclasses` with the same classpath, consider
converting the iterator to a map first, as shown below:

{% highlight scala %}
import org.clapper.classutil.ClassFinder

val finder = ClassFinder(myPath)
val classes = finder.getClasses  // classes is an Iterator[ClassInfo]
val classMap = ClassFinder.classInfoMap(classes) // runs iterator out, once
val foos = ClassFinder.concreteSubclasses("org.example.Foo", classMap)
val bars = ClassFinder.concreteSubclasses("org.example.Bar", classMap)
{% endhighlight %}

**WARNING**: `concreteSubclasses` can chew up a lot of heap space
temporarily, if called with a large classpath. Either use a "focused"
classpath, or make sure you run with a large enough maximum heap.

### The ClassInfo classes

Metadata about classes is loaded into three types of objects:

`ClassInfo` contains metadata about a class, including:

* its name
* its modifiers (whether it is an interface, is private, is public, etc.)
* data about its methods, as `MethodInfo` objects
* data about its fields, as `FieldInfo` objects

`MethodInfo` contains metadata about a method, including:

* the names of all declared exceptions it throws
* its modifiers (whether it is private, public, synchronized, etc.)
* its runtime signature

`FieldInfo` contains metadata about a method, including:

* the names of all declared exceptions it throws
* its modifiers (whether it is private, public, synchronized, etc.)
* its runtime signature

The modifiers are an abstraction: a set of enumerated values that aren't
tied to the underlying ASM representation. This allows the ClassUtil
API to be ported to other bytecode libraries, if necessary.

Please see the [API documentation][] for additional information.

## Generating Java Beans from Scala objects

### Overview

ClassUtil also supports two ways to generate beans, on the fly, from Scala
objects; these capabilities are useful when you have to interact with APIs
that require Java Beans, but you don't have the option or desire to mark
all the bean fields with Scala's `@BeanProperty` annotation.
([Case classes][] and final classes are two good examples.)

To this end, ClassUtil provides two solutions:

- `MapToBean` traverses a map and converts each name/value pair into a
  Java Beans `get` method.
- `ScalaObjectToBean` looks for Scala getter and setter methods and generates
  a wrapper bean with traditional Java `get` and `set` methods.

Both approaches will, by default, recursively convert objects. (See below
for more details.)

### `MapToBean`

`MapToBean` takes, as input, a `Map` object and generates a Java Bean with
`get` methods for each key/value pair in the map. By default, `MapToBean`
recursively converts values that are, themselves, maps. That is, if the
value for a map key is, itself, a map, `MapToBean` will convert that map to
a bean, too. Recursive generation can be disabled, if desired.

The `MapToBean` Scala object contains the method that performs the
transformation.

    def apply(map: Map[String, Any], recurse: Boolean = true): AnyRef

The first parameter is the map that is to be converted to a Java Bean. The
second parameter (`recurse`) indicates whether or not nested maps should be
automatically converted; it defaults to `true`. The bean's class name is
automatically generated, though there's a version of the `apply` method
that allows you to specify your own class name. The method returns an
instance of the newly generated bean class.

There are a few restrictions imposed on any map that is to be converted.

* Only maps with string keys can be converted.
* The string keys must be valid Java identifiers.

#### An example

An example will help clarify this part of the API:

{% highlight scala %}
import org.clapper.classutil.MapToBean

val charList = List('a', 'b', 'c')

val subMap = Map("sub1" -> 1, "sub2" -> 2)
val map =  Map("int" -> 1,
               "float" -> 2f,
               "someString" -> "three",
               "intClass" -> classOf[Int],
               "subMap" -> subMap,
               "list" -> charList)
val obj = MapToBean(map)

obj.getClass.getMethods.filter(_.getName startsWith "get").foreach(println)

def call(methodName: String) = {
    val method = obj.getClass.getMethod(methodName)
    method.invoke(obj)
}

println()
println("getSubMap returns " + call("getSubMap"))
{% endhighlight %}

This example takes a map:

{% highlight scala %}
val map =  Map("int" -> 1,
               "float" -> 2f,
               "someString" -> "three",
               "intClass" -> classOf[Int],
               "subMap" -> subMap,
               "list" -> charList)
{% endhighlight %}

and produces a Java Bean that behaves like an instance of the following class:

{% highlight java %}
public class Bean1
{
    public Integer getInt()
    {
        return 1;
    }

    public Float getFloat()
    {
        return 2f;
    }

    public Class getIntClass()
    {
        return Integer.class;
    }

    public Object getSubMap()
    {
        return MapToBean(subMap);
    }

    public scala.collection.immutable.$colon$colon getList()
    {
        return charList;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Nested maps are automatically converted via `MapToBean`, unless `recurse` is
`false`.

### `ScalaObjectToBean`

`ScalaObjectToBean` takes, as input, a Scala object and generates a Java
Bean with `get` methods for each Scala accessor. `ScalaObjectToBean` is an
alternative to using the `@BeanProperty` annotation on classes, so it is
useful for mapping case classes into Java Beans, or for mapping classes
from other APIs into Java Beans without having to extend them.

`ScalaObjectToBean` uses the following heuristics to determine which fields
to map.

First, it recognizes that any Scala `val` or `var` is really a getter method
returning some type. That is, it knows that Scala compiles the following

{% highlight scala %}
val x: Int = 0
var y: Int = 10
{% endhighlight %}

down to the equivalent of this Java code:

{% highlight java %}
private int _x = 0;
private int _y = 10;

public int x() { return _x; }
public int y() { return _y; }
public void y_$eq(int newY) { _y = newY; }
{% endhighlight %}

So, the mapper looks for Scala getter methods that take no parameters
and return some non-void (i.e., non-`Unit`) value, and it looks for
Scala setter methods that take one parameter, return void (`Unit`) and
have names ending in `_$eq`. Then, from that set of methods, the mapper
discards:

* Methods starting with "get"
* Methods that have a corresponding "get" method. In the above example,
  if there's a `getX()` method that returns an `int`, the mapper will
  assume that it's the bean version of `x()`, and it will ignore `x()`.
* Methods that aren't public.
* Any method in `java.lang.Object`.
* Any method in `scala.Product`.

If there are any methods in the remaining set, then the mapper returns a
new wrapper object that contains Java Bean versions of the setters and
getters; otherwise, the mapper returns the original Scala object. The
resulting bean delegates its calls to the original object, instead of
capturing the object's method values at the time the bean is called. That
way, if the underlying Scala object's methods return different values for
each call, the bean will reflect those changes. Also, the mapped class
delegates any methods it didn't convert back to the original object. For
instance, calling `toString` on the newly generated bean results in a call
to the original object's `toString` method.

By default, `ScalaObjectToBean` recursively converts methods that return
non-primitive, non-String values that. That is, if the value for a getter
method is a non-primitive, non-String object, `ScalaObjectToBean` will
generate a bean for that object, too. Recursive generation can be disabled,
if desired.

The `ScalaObjectToBean` Scala object contains the method that performs the
transformation.

    def apply(obj: Any, recurse: Boolean = true): AnyRef

The first parameter is the map that is to be converted to a Java Bean. The
second parameter (`recurse`) indicates whether or not nested objects should
be automatically converted; it defaults to `true`. The bean's class name is
automatically generated, though there's a version of the `apply` method
that allows you to specify your own class name. The method returns an
instance of the newly generated bean class.

#### An example

An example will help clarify this part of the API:

{% highlight scala %}
import org.clapper.classutil.ScalaObjectToBean

case class Foo(name: String, value: Int)
case class Bar(name: String, foo: Foo)

val foo = Foo("foo100", 100)
val bar = Bar("bar1", foo)
val beanFoo = ScalaObjectToBean(foo)
val beanBar = ScalaObjectToBean(bar)

println("beanFoo:")
println("-" * 30)
beanFoo.getClass.getMethods.filter(_.getName startsWith "get").foreach(println)

println("beanBar:")
println("-" * 30)
beanBar.getClass.getMethods.filter(_.getName startsWith "get").foreach(println)

def call(obj: AnyRef, methodName: String) = {
  val method = obj.getClass.getMethod(methodName)
  method.invoke(obj)
}

println()
println("beanFoo.getName returns " + call(beanFoo, "getName"))
println("beanFoo.getValue returns " + call(beanFoo, "getValue"))
println("beanBar.getName returns " + call(beanBar, "getName"))
val beanFoo2 = call(beanBar, "getFoo")
println("beanBar.getFoo returns " + beanFoo2)
println("beanBar.getFoo.getValue returns " + call(beanFoo2, "getValue"))
{% endhighlight %}

This example takes instances of two cases classes and maps them to beans.
Running it produces the following output:

    beanFoo:
    ------------------------------
    public final java.lang.String $Proxy3.getName()
    public final int $Proxy3.getValue()
    public final int $Proxy3.setValue(int)
    public final java.lang.String $Proxy3.getCopy$default$1()
    public final int $Proxy3.getCopy$default$2()
    public static java.lang.Class java.lang.reflect.Proxy.getProxyClass(java.lang.ClassLoader,java.lang.Class[]) throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
    public static java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler java.lang.reflect.Proxy.getInvocationHandler(java.lang.Object) throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
    public final native java.lang.Class java.lang.Object.getClass()

    beanBar:
    ------------------------------
    public final java.lang.String $Proxy4.getName()
    public final java.lang.String $Proxy4.setName(java.lang.String)
    public final java.lang.String $Proxy4.getCopy$default$1()
    public final java.lang.Object $Proxy4.getCopy$default$2()
    public final java.lang.Object $Proxy4.getFoo()
    public final java.lang.Object $Proxy4.setFoo(Foo)
    public static java.lang.Class java.lang.reflect.Proxy.getProxyClass(java.lang.ClassLoader,java.lang.Class[]) throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
    public static java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler java.lang.reflect.Proxy.getInvocationHandler(java.lang.Object) throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
    public final native java.lang.Class java.lang.Object.getClass()


### Caveats

#### ClassFinder

`ClassFinder` avoids any knowledge of the class loader. You give `ClassFinder`
a path (or let it use the default one in the `java.class.path` property), and 
it searches for jar files, zip file and `.class` files in that path 
(recursively). As it finds class files (in zips, jars, directories), it uses 
ASM to scan those files for the criteria it needs to match.

This approach is quite fast.

However, if the path you feed `ClassFinder` does not match the path being 
used by your current class loader, you might find classes that you then cannot
load. Alternatively, `ClassFinder` may fail to find classes that are, in fact,
loadable by your class loader.

One case where that can come up is when your class loader is using additional
class path information from your jar's manifest file. That additional 
information may not be in the `java.class.path` property, so if you allow
`ClassFinder` to use the default path, it might not find classes that your
program can, in fact, load.

`ClassUtil` _deliberately_ avoids both the class loader (for clarity of purpose
and simplicity) and reflection (for speed).

If your class loader is using a different class path than the one specified
in `java.class.path`, you'll need to assemble that path and specify it manually
to `ClassFinder`. (That may involve, for instance, reading the jar manifest.)

Perhaps in a future release I could add logic that, given a classloader, digs 
into it and extracts the search path. However, don't count on that showing
up soon, as it opens another can of worms: The class loader that programmers 
_think_ they’re using isn’t always the class loader they’re _actually_ using.
I’m not sure whether I’d be helping or making things more confusing by adding 
that kind of "helper" capability.

#### MapToBean and ScalaObjectToBean

The beans generated by `MapToBean` and `ScalaObjectToBean` can really only
be used via reflection. Their types (classes) are created on the fly, so
they cannot be imported ahead of time. However, a reflected bean works well
with APIs that expect such things.

### Under the covers

Internally, `MapToBean` and `ScalaObjectToBean` use [ASM][] to create a
Java interface from the map or object. They then use
[`java.lang.reflect.Proxy`](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html)
to create a dynamic implementation of the interface that satisfies the
`get` method calls directly from the original object.

This approach turns out to be simpler to implement (and, therefore, simpler
to reason about) than directly generating a class that serves up the map's
values.
